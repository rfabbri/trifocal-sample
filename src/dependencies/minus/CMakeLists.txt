# -- MINUS: Open-MVG specific build style --------------------------------------
# optional, header-only library can be used without this library
# library is useful when the function will be used in many places
# to avoid having to include Minus many times and slowdown the compiler
#
# For OpenMVG it we do this precompile so that MINUS is always compiled with
# highly optimized compiler flags, even when OpenMVG is debug
